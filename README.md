## OCB AES

This is a pure C implementation of AES. It is in [OCB 3](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/ocb-faq.htm#versions) mode, which is the **best** AES mode!

Strongest parameters of the strongest algorithm: This code is only for 256 bit keys. Besides, it has TAGLEN of 128 bits.

> OCB is by far the best mode, as it allows encryption and authentication in a single pass.

> [OCB is] Usually much fasterâ€”like a factor of 2-6 [compared to other AES modes]...

~ [Phillip Rogaway, OCB developer](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/ocb-faq.htm#performance)

See the top of main.c for the notes about patents. It's actually pretty "free" software patent!

My work on coding it? I've made my work public domain! Have a nice day using it!

Timing-attack proof. Everything is constant time, as long as the data length, nonce length, and associated data length is constant.

> Using constant-time blockcipher and double() implementations eliminates most (if not all) sources of timing attacks on OCB.

No `#include` for simplicity

Compatible with systems where `sizeof(char) > 1`

Full name: `AEAD_AES_256_OCB_TAGLEN128`

### What is Associated Data?

So, do you know "proof of authenticity"? You can send one a message in plaintext,
then hash and sign it. It works the same way: You can add "associated data" as that
plaintext while encrypting. Your friend will need the know the associated data to decode the ciphertext.
If decoding succeeds, your friend will be sure that your associated data was untampered. (under some assumptions)

Furthermore, the associated data does not make the ciphertext longer.
